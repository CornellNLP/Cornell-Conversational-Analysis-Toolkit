This toolkit contains tools to extract conversational features and analyze social phenomena in conversations, using a [single unified interface](https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation/architecture.html) inspired by (and compatible with) scikit-learn.  Several large [conversational datasets](https://github.com/CornellNLP/ConvoKit#datasets) are included together with scripts exemplifying the use of the toolkit on these datasets. The latest version is [4.1.2](https://github.com/CornellNLP/ConvoKit/releases/tag/v4.1.2) (released June 26, 2026); follow the [project on GitHub](https://github.com/CornellNLP/ConvoKit) to keep track of updates.

Join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/WMFqMWgz6P) to stay informed, connect with fellow developers, and be part of an engaging space where we share progress, discuss features, and tackle issues together.

Read our [documentation](https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation) or try ConvoKit in our [interactive tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/CornellNLP/ConvoKit/blob/master/examples/Introduction_to_ConvoKit.ipynb).

The toolkit currently implements features for:

### [Linguistic coordination](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Echoes_of_power.html) <sub><sup>[(API)](https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation/coordination.html)</sup></sub>

A measure of linguistic influence (and relative power) between individuals or groups based on their use of function words.
Example: [exploring the balance of power in the U.S. Supreme Court](https://github.com/CornellNLP/ConvoKit/blob/master/examples/coordination/examples.ipynb).

### [Politeness strategies](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Politeness.html) <sub><sup>[(API)](https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation/politenessStrategies.html)</sup></sub>

A set of lexical and parse-based features correlating with politeness and impoliteness.
Example: [understanding the (mis)use of politeness strategies in conversations gone awry on Wikipedia](https://github.com/CornellNLP/ConvoKit/blob/master/examples/conversations-gone-awry/Conversations_Gone_Awry_Prediction.ipynb).

### [Expected Conversational Context Framework](https://tisjune.github.io/research/dissertation) <sub><sup>[(API)](https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation/expected_context_model.html)</sup></sub>

A framework for characterizing utterances and terms based on their expected conversational context, consisting of model implementations and wrapper pipelines.
Examples: [deriving question types and other characterizations in British parliamentary question periods](https://github.com/CornellNLP/ConvoKit/blob/master/convokit/expected_context_framework/demos/parliament_demo.ipynb),
[exploration of Switchboard dialog acts corpus](https://github.com/CornellNLP/ConvoKit/blob/master/convokit/expected_context_framework/demos/switchboard_exploration_demo.ipynb),  [examining Wikipedia talk page discussions](https://github.com/CornellNLP/ConvoKit/blob/master/convokit/expected_context_framework/demos/wiki_awry_demo.ipynb) and [computing the orientation of justice utterances in the US Supreme Court](https://github.com/CornellNLP/ConvoKit/blob/master/convokit/expected_context_framework/demos/scotus_orientation_demo.ipynb)

<!-- ### [Prompt types](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Asking_too_much.html) <sub><sup>[(API)](https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation/promptTypes.html)</sup></sub>

An unsupervised method for grouping utterances and utterance features by their rhetorical role.
Examples: [extracting question types in the U.K. parliament](https://github.com/CornellNLP/ConvoKit/blob/master/examples/prompt-types/prompt-type-wrapper-demo.ipynb), [extended version demonstrating additional functionality](https://github.com/CornellNLP/ConvoKit/blob/master/examples/prompt-types/prompt-type-demo.ipynb), [understanding the use of conversational prompts in conversations gone awry on Wikipedia](https://github.com/CornellNLP/ConvoKit/blob/master/examples/conversations-gone-awry/Conversations_Gone_Awry_Prediction.ipynb).

Also includes functionality to extract surface motifs to represent utterances, used in the above paper [(API)](https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation/phrasingMotifs.html). -->

### [Hypergraph conversation representation](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Patterns_of_participant_interactions.html) <sub><sup>[(API)](https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation/hyperconvo.html)</sup></sub>
A method for extracting structural features of conversations through a hypergraph representation.
Example: [hypergraph creation and feature extraction, visualization and interpretation on a subsample of Reddit](https://github.com/CornellNLP/ConvoKit/blob/master/examples/hyperconvo/hyperconvo_demo.ipynb).

### [Linguistic diversity in conversations](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Finding_your_voice__linguistic_development.html) <sub><sup>[(API)](https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation/speakerConvoDiversity.html)</sup></sub>
A method to compute the linguistic diversity of individuals within their own conversations, and between other individuals in a population.
Example: [speaker conversation attributes and diversity example on ChangeMyView](https://github.com/CornellNLP/ConvoKit/blob/master/examples/speaker-convo-attributes/speaker-convo-diversity-demo.ipynb)

The methods to compute the extent to which utterances redirect the flow of the conversation (Redirection) and to measure the log-likelihoods of utterances given a defined conversation context (Utterance Likelihood).
Example: [redirection in supreme court oral arguments](https://github.com/CornellNLP/ConvoKit/blob/master/convokit/redirection/redirectionDemo.ipynb)

### [Pivotal Moment Measure]( ) <sub><sup>[(API)](https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation/pivotal.html)</sup></sub>
